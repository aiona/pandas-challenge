\f0\fs24 \cf0 	Several conclusions can be drawn about player demographics and the amount that they spend in this game. One can conclude that males are more likely to play this game and spend money than females (84% of players are male, and they made 84% of the purchases). Gaming has been an area that largely appeals to men over women. Players between the ages of 20-29 make the majority of purchases (~60%). More analysis could be done to show the breakdown of age groups by gender. It could indicate additional relationships between spending, age and gender. The data also shows that male players spent the least per person out of the three gender groups ($4.07). Further analysis could indicate if there is a gender preference for particular items, which would provide more context to gender spending.}
